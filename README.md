### Getting started

```sh
# First, make sure Electron is installed.
npm install electron-prebuilt -g

# Start the app!
electron .
```

Note: Soon, this will be distributed to a number of non-profits. Please don't distribute it ahead of time though, as I'd like to make sure it's QA'ed on Windows & Mac. :)
